# SQL-Loan-Management-analysis
ðŸ“Š Overview

This project analyzes loan and customer data using SQL to uncover insights about customer behavior, loan distribution, and repayment performance. It simulates how data analysts work in the banking and finance sector.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Database: MySQL

Skills Used: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, TRIGGERS, STORED PROCEDURES

Dataset: Synthetic dataset (CSV files with 500+ records of customers, loans, and regions)

ðŸ§© Steps Performed

Imported datasets into MySQL database

Cleaned and joined tables (customer, income, loan status, region)

Analyzed:

Loan approval rates by region and type

Customer income distribution

High-risk (default) loan patterns

Gender & region-wise repayment trends

Created stored procedures and triggers for data integrity

Exported visual outputs for reporting

ðŸ“ˆ Insights

Most loan defaults occur in low-income groups (< â‚¹40,000/month)

Home loans have the lowest default rate

The North region shows highest loan approval percentage

Customer retention is higher in regions with good income consistency

ðŸš€ Key Learnings

Practical SQL data analysis workflow

Importance of data cleaning before analysis

Building reusable queries and stored procedures

Translating SQL results into business insights

ðŸ§  Future Enhancements

Connect SQL database to Power BI / Tableau for visualization

Build a Python-based dashboard (pandas + matplotlib)

Add data validation test cases for cleaner ETL pipeline
